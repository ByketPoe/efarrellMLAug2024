Machine Learning Analysis of Abalone Dataset
=======

This repository contains a machine learning analysis of mass and length measurements of abalone shellfish. The data is also categorised according to the sex of the samples (male, female or infant). The aim is to assess if these measurements can be used to predict the age of the abalone. 

It is important to note that the data refers to abalone, not balogna:

This analysis is presented in a Jupyter notebook. The original dataset can be found at the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone

Install and Run
=======

Running the notebook to render the content and run the code requires your machine to have Jupyter installed. You can find information on how to install here: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html

Jupyter Notebook can then be run from the command line as follows:

    jupyter notebook

This opens a dashboard in your browser where you can navigate to the notebook saved to your machine and view/run it from there.
