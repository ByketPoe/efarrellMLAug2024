    "Length, diameter, height, whole_weight, shucked_weight, viscera_weight and shell weight are continuous.\n",
    "Rings are integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to consider the difference between data types before beginning analysis, as they will influence the type of calculations that can be done. Categorical types of data assign the observed result to one of a few fixed, finite categories. In this case, the observation can be Female, Male or Infant. The rest of the data types are numeric; the length and mass measurements are continuous and the rings are integers. Continuous means that the numbers are real, and include all decimal numbers between whole numbers. Integers refers to whole numbers only. This makes sense when one thinks about the fact that it is a count of the number of rings found in the shell of the abalone - it would be difficult to have a fraction of a ring. \n",

    "#### Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical values do not have numerical scale, the data just sits in the appropriate category it belongs to.\n",
    "The continuous data in this dataset are made up of length measurements (in mm) and mass measurements (in grams). \n",
    "\n",
    "Having all lengths of the same unit and all masses of the same units of measurement makes it easier to compare lengths with each other and masses with each other. No unit conversion needs to take place within the Python code to scale all of the measurements with each other, and summary statistics such as average and standard deviation can be compared between different variables with no mathematical manipulation required. {scale when plotting}{scale if different units}{plotting logarithmically if data isn't close enough in scale}\n",
    "\n",
    "If one wanted to do some rudimentary density calculations, this could be possible with the assumption of the Abalone specimens having an ellipsoid shape. Density is measured as mass per unit volume. The length measurements could be used to calculate volume {insert calculation}, but this would need to be converted from mm3 to cm3. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs vs outputs\n",
    "When doing analysis below, all variables except Rings will be considered to be Input variables. This is because it is hoped that these input variables can be used to predict the output variable, age (which is known by the number of rings). "
